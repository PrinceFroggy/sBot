Dear User's,

Since the beginning of this development, I had the intention of releasing for free; which I did.

A year and a half later, Supreme encrypted their item names...which I got around.

A year and a half later, supreme encrypted their URL's...which I got around.

Just recently, Supreme blocked the native webBrowser control...which I got around.

I won the war, lost the battle per se.

This time around, I found a library called CEFSharp using the .net framework 4.2.5.

This webBrowser is a Chrome webBrowser and uses javascript, not DOM.

I released this unfinished (90% finished) due to it has caused me unnecessary stress while also being IP banned.

If you navigate around my source, you will notice the flow of direction I was going towards and the differences
between sBot and csBot (sBot updated).

None of the ID's for SUPREME has changed; just needed a differen't way of accessing the values, hence javascript.

Overall, I will be starting my next project of a TicketMaster bot.

Salute,

Andrew Justin Solesa
