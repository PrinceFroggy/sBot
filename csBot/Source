It has come to my attention that I have been IP banned from Supreme New York website.
It has also come to my attention the user chenhil copied my source; therefore, un-able to update after 2 years 
due to the first round of encryption (not even committing to the second round or third).

Due to this IP ban, I can no longer continue my effort for releasing a new and improved sBot.

Originally, Supreme tried to screw me by encrypting their item names; however, as you can see in the source,
I got around that easily.

Just recently, they blocked the native control webBrowser from being able to navigate to the checkout.

Overall, I found a way to get around the block, using CEFSharp .net framework 4.2.5.

Just today, it came to my attention that I have been IP banned from the whole Supreme website; therefore, without further ado..
I would love to introduce to you sBot (csBot) close to finished.

CEFSharp uses the Chromium webBrowser and does not like DOM events; therefore, as you can see in this source, 
I am using javascript to navigate. JAVASCRIPT is the main feature for this browser.

Thank you all for your kind Stars, Forks, Issues, and Watches.

Sorry that I could not fully update my bot as I can't even debug due to the IP ban; however, 
this was an amazing start close to finish!

I will attempt at times where using a un-blocked IP to finish this and release!

Enjoy,

Andrew.
